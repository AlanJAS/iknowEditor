What is this?

I Know Editor is a development tool to create other 'I Know'
activities.  Maps of cities are added as images and cities are added
to the map by clicking on any point on the map and changing the name
of the city on the right panel of the activity.

The created city can be exported as a Python file which is stored in
the users home directory and can be used to create an 'I Know'
activity.
